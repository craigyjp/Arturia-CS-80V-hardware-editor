# Arturia-CS-80V-hardware-editor
Seemed like a good idea to create a hardware editor for the Arturia CS-80V plugin. 

Every front panel control mapped bar one (link).

LED sliders with dimming.

Possible to use as a universal editor with 119 CC controls for other Arturia products or synths.

MIDI in/out, USB midi

Ribbon controller to be implemented in future release.
